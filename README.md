# Building Android for Raspberry Pi 4B

# General notes
This is project experimental; it is not guaranteed to build on all possible
systems and it is not guaranteed to run on all Raspberry Pi 4 configurations.
You need a fair amount of knowledge of Linux and Android to get this to work.
Be warned.

My build system:
 - Ubuntu 20.04

My Raspberry Pi configuration:
 - Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB
 - 7" HDMI touch screen 1024x600. There are many available. The one I use
   is from Elecrow

This is part of an AOSP and AAOS Meetup project: look there for full instructions
